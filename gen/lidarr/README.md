# Helm chart (V3) - lidarr

## lidarr

[Lidarr](https://github.com/lidarr/Lidarr) is a music collection manager for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new tracks from your favorite artists and will grab, sort and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality of files already downloaded when a better quality format becomes available.

The the docker image is part of the the [`linuxserver.io`](https://www.linuxserver.io/) collection, it has a great [documentation](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-lidarr) that cover all the image features.

## About

This chart was created with [Node.JS script](https://noygal.github.com/helm/scripts/nodejs), and relay on [`base-chart`](https://noygal.github.com/helm/base-chart) dependency for templates functionally - allowing the use of highly flexible single `value.yaml` file for describing the chart. Please refer to `base-chart` documentation for a full API description. The script scrape the [docker-documentation](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-documentation) repository, that contains the documentation for all the `linuxserver.io` images.

The the default values for the script are set to my local network configuration - [`k3s`](https://k3s.io/) cluster on raspberry pi 4 and NFS server on `192.168.1.10`, you can use the script [configuration](https://noygal.github.com/helm/scripts/nodejs/config.js) to generate charts that fit your configuration.
